''' Pre-configure connection string using a default server 
''' and catalog. In a normal solution this is all that should
''' be required but if at run time the connection needs to
''' change you can change the server and catalog in the class
''' which inherits from this class.
''' 
''' BaseExceptionsHandler provides properties which any
''' class inherits from BaseSqlServerConnections can set
''' a property then when the caller method throws an exception
''' you can mark a property that an exception occured
''' then in the high level caller (e.g. in a form) can
''' ask "was there an exception" and if so get the exception
''' via LastException property in BaseExceptionsHandler.
